The area is close to the micro regions of El Cielito, Las Flores and El Sauce, where we work with several producers of similar\u00a0size and quality as Miguel, including his neighbour Ramon of Benedicion (whose coffee was in Holiday Celebration Espresso previously). Miguel is producing a small quantity, but high\u00a0quality coffee, and has been steadily striving for excellence in each harvest. His main goal for this past season was improved quality: picking ripe cherries, as well as focusing on other husbandry practices.\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003EDrying coffee properly is critical to the taste and longevity of green coffee quality, and by extension the sweetness and complexity of the cup we get to drink. By using a solar dryer (raised mesh beds with a hoop frame and plastic cover), there is assurance that even drying of the coffee is possible in the\u00a0misty cool conditions of El Cedral.\u00a0\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003EAfter picking, cherry is pulped - skin and some\u00a0mucilage is removed before the coffee is fermented for 12 - 16 hours. After, the remaining mucilage is washed off, and the coffee is dried on solar driers. Honduras has an unusually long harvest season, beginning in November and ending as late as end of May. We have decided to use both regular harvest (November - February approximately) and Late Harvest (February - May approximately) for this year\u2019s Holiday Celebration Espresso because we feel it leads to a complex cup and one of the\u00a0sweetest espressos we\u2019ve tasted all year.\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003EIntense fruit aroma, rich texture, and exceptional\u00a0structure, with sweet flavours of caramel\u00a0and pineapple.\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"column\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00a0\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are the parameters that we've been using on the Holiday Espresso (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E18 grams of freshly ground coffee\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETimer for 28 seconds\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPull ~ 36-37 grams of liquid espresso\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGrouphead at 200\u00b0 F\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E9 bars of pressure\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E","published_at":"2013-11-14T20:57:14-08:00","created_at":"2013-11-13T14:34:34-08:00","vendor":"49th Parallel","type":"Accessories","tags":["coffee","espresso","honduras"],"price":2000,"price_min":2000,"price_max":2000,"available":true,"price_varies":false,"compare_at_price":null,"compare_at_price_min":0,"compare_at_price_max":0,"compare_at_price_varies":false,"variants":[{"id":403369425,"title":"Holiday Celebration Espresso","options":["Holiday Celebration Espresso"],"option1":"Holiday Celebration Espresso","option2":null,"option3":null,"price":2000,"weight":454,"compare_at_price":null,"inventory_quantity":1,"inventory_management":null,"inventory_policy":"deny","available":true,"sku":"HCE16","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":false,"barcode":null}],"images":["//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0058/4952/products/holidayespresso.png?v=1384382327","//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0058/4952/products/IMG_5320.jpg?v=1386375270"],"featured_image":"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0058/4952/products/holidayespresso.png?v=1384382327","options":[{"name":"Title","position":1}],"url":"/products/holiday-celebration-espresso-1"}
